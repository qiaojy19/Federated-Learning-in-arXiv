# Federated Learning Weekly

This repository gathers federated learning papers submitted to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=federated+learning&terms-0-field=all&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-year=2020&date-filter_by=date_range&date-from_date=2021-04-01&date-to_date=&date-date_type=announced_date_first&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-submitted_date) every week.

Notes:
- **ZZZ**, which means a paper has not accepted by any conference or journal yet, is used for sorting.
- This [Tencent document](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DSU9MTG5QWm91SFBh) gathers papers **accepted** by conference or journal.
- This **homepage** will only show papers of **this month**, others are in correspondind hyperlink.
